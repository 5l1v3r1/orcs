OSINT Resource Classification System

# What is this?
This site is (hopefully) where a bunch of people will get together and create an OSINT Resource Classification System that can be used to systematically organize and refer to types of resources used in OSINT work.

# The problem
If you look around the internet, you will see many resources showing links to a variety of web sites, tools, and documents that can be useful in OSINT/ThreatIntel/Recon work. The problem is that each site owner makes their own names for the categories. An example would be the https://start.me/p/b56G5Q/search-engines has 15 different types of search engines whereas http://osintframework.com/ has about 10...and they do not overlap. So comparing "apples-to-apples" and looking for similar sites across these bookmark sites is extremely challenging. 

# The solution
I'm hoping that this site will serve as a central place for many of us to come together and begin making OSINT simpler by agreeing on standard categories and subcats for our resources.

If this happens, sites like https://yoga.osint.ninja will be extremely powerful as it could link directly to each person's bookmark site at a specific category. 

# The plea
I need help with this. I need those people that have bookmark sites, PDFs, and other resources to join up and make their voices heard (in a positive way). Participate and let's make something great together.

# The location
I imagine using this Github project for this work...at least initially. The Wiki https://github.com/WebBreacher/orcs/wiki and Projects features can help organize and publish our content.

We have a private channel in the Rocket Chat https://osint.team server for discussions.
